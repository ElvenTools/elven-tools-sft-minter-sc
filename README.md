## Elven Tools SFT Minter Smart Contract

The SFT minter will be a complementary tool of the new NFT minter but will also be used as an independent tool in many other use cases. Because there is no actual ETA for the new NFT minter, the SFT minter will have basic functionality at first and will be developed in time. But please add your requirements. Use the GitHub issues for that.

## Current functionality

- issue collection
- configure and manage a collection
- mint and send SFTs (payment with EGLD)
- burn and add quantity

## For later

- allow lists
- more configuration per address
- what have you... let me know

## How to use it

The simplest way would be with [Elven Tools CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elven-tools). You can find all the guidance here: [TODO: add docs]()

You could also use [mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/mxpy-cli) tool. Also check the interaction snippets included in the repository. You can run them through VS Code and MultiversX IDE extension.

The code is open source, and there is an ABI file.
